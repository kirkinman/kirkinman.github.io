					<h1>Tune a Guitar!</h1>
					
					So you bought a brand new guitar. You plug it into something that makes noises. Hopefully an amp. Amps are better than refrigerators. Fo sho. Acoustic guitars donâ€™t need any amp or any cables. You donâ€™t even have to worry about cables and connectors. If that is what you want, an acoustic guitar might be the way to go.
					
					Whether you play acoustic or electric, it pays to know how to tune a guitar! Why? Because if you play a guitar that is out of tune, it will not sound right no matter how well it is played. Each note will be off. 
					<h2> The Way </h2>
					
					Playing every note the wrong way is just not the way to go. Tune your guitar with the nobs at the end of the string. Those are the tuning pegs. 
					
					On any guitar tuning journey it is best to get a tuner. Life on the guitar is so much easier with the help of a little bit of technology.
					
					Tuners have come a long way. In the past people didnâ€™t trust them all that much. Even after using a tuner a guitar might have still been out of tune. Today there are many great tuners that can pickup the smallest imperfection. Even if you are off tune by the tiniest little bit!
					
					<h2>Chart</h2>
					
					All you have to know is that the first string is E. The first string is the thickest one on the top. Below is a chart so that you can be careful. Even if you have a tuner you should be careful. For instance, if you tune one of the smallest strings wrong it can snap. If your strings snap you have to go out and buy a full new pack. Good luck finding a music store that sells B strings only.
					<br>
					<br>
					I recorded these notes on a tuned electric guitar for you:
					<br>
					<br>
					<div class="ul">
						<div class="li">
							String 1: Low E (it is the thickest)
							<div id="lowE" class="tuning">ðŸ”‰</div>
						</div>
						<div class="li">
							String 2: A
							<div id="A" class="tuning">ðŸ”‰</div>
						</div>
						<div class="li">
							String 3: D
							<div id="D" class="tuning">ðŸ”‰</div>
						</div>
						<div class="li">
							String 4: G (this string and the others  below might look different from the first ones)
							<div id="G" class="tuning">ðŸ”‰</div>
						</div>
						<div class="li">
							String 5: B
							<div id="B" class="tuning">ðŸ”‰</div>
						
						</div>
						<div class="li">
							String 6: High E (the thinnest)
							<div id="highE" class="tuning">ðŸ”‰</div>
		
						</div>
						
						
					</div>

					If you are tuning by ear you should have a tuner to check the first E. From there you can tune the rest of the strings. The quickest way is to find the note of the string that is tuned. Find the A note on the Low E. Play it with open A (the second string). If they sound in tune they will sound the same but the A higher an octave. If the sound waves in and out of the octave it is still out of tune. 
					
					Check the tuning with a tuner or with a guitar that is already in tune. There are many resources online that will play the Low E exactly in tune. Use the internet if you do not have a tuner.
					
					Conclusion
					
					In conclusion, when tuning a guitar use a tuner. In my experience the best tuners are on pedals. Tuners for acoustic guitars come in many varieties and can clamp on. Always make sure that the Low E is correct before tuning the rest of the guitar. Following this guide can save some time and money down the road on strings.
					
					Happy tuning!

					You deserve a riff :)
