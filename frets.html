					<h1>Fret Types</h1>
					
					One consideration guitarists should make is fret type. Choosing the right type of fret is important. That doesn’t mean to fret about frets. Nil fretting is best when picking out frets. But what is a nil fret? 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Jokes aside (not), this article is about the fret wire on a guitar. This article is not about the space between the fret wire. The space between the fret wires are called the neck. The neck is made of wood and the fret wire is not. Fret wire is made of wire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not the wires used to plug in awesome guitars! Plugging those in means you had better get a leather vest and some dark sunglasses, you rock star.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rock stars also have hair-dos of some kind, but there is no need to fret about hair styles when getting a radical sounding axe. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Speaking of radical sounding axes, they come with different fret types. Big or small.  great tuners that can pickup the smallest imperfection. Even if you are off tune by the tiniest little bit!

					<h2>Which Guitar Should I Purchase?</h2>
					<br>
                    
					This article couldn't just end there! Many guitarists are beginners. Additionally, information about amazing fret wires on radical guitars can help when buying a new guitar. For instance, guitars can be priced like cars or motorcycles. Thus, buying the wrong fret style could be a huge blunder for any guitarist. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fun fact: the sound the guitar makes will be the same with different fret types. The fret type preference is not about the sound of the guitar, but the way it is played.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What is the difference? The difference is meaningful. That is, if you buy that vehicle-priced radical axe and don’t like the frets, you can change the fret wire. Swapping the fret wire for a different will not affect the sound quality. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While the sound quality would be the same, the feel of the frets would change. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Can you just forget about radical axes and rock star dance moves for a second?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Use jumbo frets if you play hard and slide often. Wider frets slide the best. Imagine a speed bump. In this example, drive a race car over the speed bump. If the speed bump is tall and narrow you break the spoilers. If the speed bump is more like a hill you might not feel a thing!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When it comes to fret types it is all about preference, so don’t fret about crashing race cars.
                    <br>

                    <h2>Are You Like Tarzan?</h2>
                    <br>
                   
                    If you don’t play that rough or slide often, tall and narrow frets might be your thing. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Tall and narrow is not low and wide. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Are you like Turdyman? I mean Tarzan? Because an important consideration is durability of the guitar overall. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="italics">
                    Tarzan was raised by primates in the jungles. He slid down branches like they were slides and adapted to the wild jungle. When outsiders brought him to the concrete jungle they said ‘Welcome to the jungle, it gets tougher and tougher to slide on anything!”

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Point is: when it comes to fret wires it gets worse every day. Narrow-tall frets wear down easier because of the shape. There is not as much material where the string meets the wire. This could be a hairy choice for someone with that primate style.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Don’t fret about getting bit by the frets. Just play the guitar and ask yourself : do you slide like Tarzan down the branch?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, consider the guitar’s durability and feel.
